## Project Overview

Second Brain is a full-stack project designed to help users organize, share, and manage their content efficiently. It provides a seamless interface for adding, sharing, and visualizing personal knowledge or information, making it a powerful tool for productivity and collaboration.

## Optimization Tasks

### To further enhance the project, the following optimizations are planned:

1. Add Zod Validation
   Integrate Zod for schema validation on both frontend and backend.
   Ensure proper validation for user inputs, API request payloads, and responses.
2. Implement Try-Catch Blocks
   Wrap all asynchronous calls in try-catch blocks to improve error handling.
   Display user-friendly error messages in the frontend for API failures.
3. Optimize Backend
   Refactor backend code for better readability and maintainability.
   Optimize database queries to reduce latency.
   Add caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data.
   Implement rate-limiting and request validation middleware.
4. Improve UI
   Enhance the overall look and feel of the interface.
   Add animations for smoother transitions.
   Improve responsiveness for mobile devices.
   Add dark mode support.
